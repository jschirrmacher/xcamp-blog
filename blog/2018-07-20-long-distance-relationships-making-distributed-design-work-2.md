**Interactive Session (de/en)**

Design presents unique challenges for virtual collaboration. When working with distributed teams, it’s hard to re-create 
the type of visual and open environment needed for interactive design processes.

To be effective, you must assume a “digital first” mindset. This doesn’t mean simply transferring your old ways to an 
electronic medium: it means rethinking your approach.

In this interactive talk at Xcamp, we will give you practical advice on how to make virtual collaboration work for you. 
We’ll demonstrate effective remote collaboration for design live on stage to see our recommendations in action.

In the end, digital collaboration isn’t just a hurdle to overcome, it’s an opportunity for organizational change and for 
design to spread throughout the organization, regardless of location.
