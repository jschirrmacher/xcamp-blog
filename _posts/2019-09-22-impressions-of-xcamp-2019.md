Recently, I was lucky to be invited to the "XCamp", a barcamp for agile management and 
digital innovation. The one-day event took place in a really special location, namely the innovation
center of DB Systel GmbH, on the 30th floor, high above the roofs of Frankfurt.

The purpose of this open barcamp format was bringing together regional innovationdrivers and
innovators to exchange their experiences and new #methods of agile working.

Currently working in the Transformation Office of the Technology and Innovation Department of Deutsche Telekom,
I could contribute well to barcamp sessions, while, at the same time broadening my horizon and gaining new and
exciting insights.

Summed up: I definitely enjoyed being an active part of this unconference and am more than motivated to join
again in 2020!

Thanks for the numerous enriching exchanges as well as for the great networking - among others with Jens Bothmer,
Joachim Schirrmacher, Darren Cooper, Daniel Andrisek and Nelson Javier Mejia!
